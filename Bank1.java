/* A boy has his money deposited $1000, $1500 and $2000 in banks-Bank A, Bank B and Bank C respectively.
We have to print the money deposited by him in a particular bank.
Create a class 'Bank' with a function 'getBalance' which returns 0. 
Make its three subclasses named 'BankA', 'BankB' and 'BankC' with a function with the same 
name 'getBalance' which returns the amount deposited in that particular bank. 
Call the function 'getBalance' by the object of each of the three banks.*/
